        <p>A friend wanted a replacement part for his Xiaomi M365 scooter.
Of course there are lots of these on Thingiverse.
Settled on an extra shopping bag hook.</p>
<p>I tried to print with the bed at 45 degrees, didn’t stick well at all.
I raised it back to 50 and cleaned the bed - much better.
To avoid elephant feet, is there a way I can reduce it after the first layers have adhered?
Yes, but only after first layer (maybe that means the floor, so first <em>layers</em>).</p>
<p>I’m going for some overhang here with no supports… mainly because I didn’t need support in both parts
It should end up fine because it’s a bridge, but maybe a layer or two could be messy.
I also tightened the X and Y axes after what happened with the second Nintendo 64 logo.
Since these parts are to be strong, I used thicker walls with 40% infill and some other features.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200902_105313.jpg" alt="The overhang turned out fine wihout supports, this time"></p>
<p>The bridge went OK!
I got some curling on one sharp end of the hook, damn.
I want to use different settings for different models, but print them at the same time.
I would have used supports on one, and a brim on the other.
Or maybe a brim only on sharp corners?
Maybe there’s a way to have a brim easier to remove, or see to remove?</p>
<p>Bring on Cura plugins!
There’s one where you can set manual brims with a mouse click, I’ll use this in future!</p>

        <p>Well, the last attempt was a waste of time.
Note to self: Do not expect things like this to go together!</p>
<p>I used a very old glue gun, which made things worse.
But it was very difficult to find the brimm boundaries, assemble, and keep together.
Just print a solid one.</p>
<p>No brim this time, 90 degrees seems fine most of the time, especially with good vertical height and repeated layers.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200901_192112.jpg" alt="Completed parts"></p>
<p>I got very slight elephant feet at 50 degrees, perhaps I can go down to 45?
Also the layers aren’t completely flush.
I guess I should tighten my belts.
Since this model doesn’t have a ‘back’, I tried to hide the seams randomly.
They don’t look particularly random on the print.
I guess this one is easy to sand, though.</p>

        <p>This one took lots of time, over 5 hours in fact.
I have always wanted a 3D Nintendo 64 logo.
I only have one extruder, and there was a design which you could print with different filaments in series and then assemble.
I don’t have each of the colours though, but this would be interesting.
Because each piece was face down, then all faces would be nide and smooth.</p>

60 degrees on the bed must have been slightly too hot.</p>

Let’s try a compliant mechanism.</p>
<p>The first try started curling up very early on.
I didn’t need it before, but I tried using a glue stick on the bed surface.
This helped a lot, but I don’t like using it.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200831_132123.jpg" alt="Complete chip-clip"></p>
<p>Now I realise if I had done a brim, then the sharp corners would have something to hold them down.
Next time.</p>

        <p>It’s pretty difficult to move the bed around without touching the bed plate.
This is sometimes hot, and I also don’t want to change the levelling.
Luckily there are many solutions on Thingiverse for the Ender 3, which will be compatible with my Ender 3 V2.
I settled on one which was easier to print without supports, and also featured bed screw locking clips.</p>
<p>Everything printed fine (but I printed an extra part because I forgot to flip it…)
Nice to see the cool gyroid infill pattern at a larger scale!</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200831_004544.jpg" alt="All the bed handle pieces"></p>
<p>The handle is flimsier than I predicted, and doesn’t leave enough room to mount the webcam with my tripod.
This is OK, because Octolapse provides some great features and I don’t need to couple the camera and bed motion.
The clips are awfl as well.
I think the intention is to glue them in for some reason, and they just keep falling out.
The shape doesn’t account for the different relative directions of the screws either.
At least the bed handle will come in useful.</p>

However, I did find that the USB connection cable causes some weird issues.
Turning off the printer, and even unplugging it, it continues to be powered somehow.
I had to cut the power wire out of the cable to prevent this from happening.</p>
<h3 id="Power-problems"><a href="#Power-problems" class="headerlink" title="Power problems?"></a>Power problems?</h3><p>No, I tried many sockets, examining the internal connections, even powering off other appliances in the room.</p>

The joint between the thermocouple and the rest of the wire is broken inside the heatshrink.
So when the X position exceeds soemthing like 100mm, a thermal runaway is prevented by rebooting the printer.
I wish it would at least tell me, or something!</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200829_011408.jpg" alt="Broken thermocouple wire"></p>
<p>Soldering the thermocouple would change the resistance and the target temperatures could be very wrong.
Thermocouples are cheap on Amazon, I’ll just get a few replacements.
But…
In the meantime, I want to print!
So I’ve wrapped the wire around tightly, and electrical taped it… Seems to be OK..!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I want to be able to print tripod-mountable things, with the first order of business being a webcam mount so I can film timelapses of my prints.
Lots of these exist on Thingiverse already, even for this specific webcam (an old Logitech C130), but I’m not satisfied.
It shouldn’t require extra bolts!
So I’ll design one myself.
This means being able to screw onto a standard tripod screw, so I’ll have to print the thread.
I know this would be a real pain to model manually.
I found that Autodesk Fusion 360 can mostly automate this, and it’s relatively simple to add clearances!</p>
<p>First, I designed a simple hex nut without any extra clearance (B2), as the bolt would be a real steel one and not a printed one.
This came out fine, but was much too tight.
It was even difficult to force something into it.
I put some text on it to keep a track of the type and settings, but it didn’t come out at all.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200829_024629.jpg" alt="First bolt print"></p>
<p>The second has some clearance.
This was easier to force into, but still became more difficult the further it went in.
The more-engraved text was not readable.</p>
<p>Now I was pretty sure that I could get the nut right the next time, so would combined it with the mounting part in a single print.</p>
<p>Using the original as reference, I made a 1:1 reconstruction using a digital caliper and Fusion 360.
This took lots of time but I still have to learn how it works.
History, sketches, components, analysis planes, bevels, even exporting to <code>.STL</code> isn’t obvious or straight forward.
The original piece was a bit complicated, with flat sections to restrict movement and provide some friction.</p>
<p>The final result was almost perfect.
The thread is great.
The bevel is less than I expected.
The end recesses are not wide enough for the end cap and screw, but I wanted it to go in so I forced it.
This caused it to split slightly, but otherwise the webcam is held well, and all movement is as it was on the old one.
Nice!
I’ll adjust the design but I won’t re-print it.</p>

        <p>My new 3D printer (Creality Ender 3 V2) arrived today!
It only took 5 days to arrive, from CZ.
This weekend is a long one due to the bank holiday - time to build!
I’m keeping this blog as a self-reference for the things I learned, and somewhere to post my settings and photos.</p>
<h2 id="Construction"><a href="#Construction" class="headerlink" title="Construction"></a>Construction</h2><p>I set it up very carfeully following YouTube videos.
It was difficult to tell which way I had to tighten the concentric casters, but everything went smoothly.</p>

<p>I did however scratch the bed a bit.
Not convinced it’s a problem.
When wiping the bed down, the scratches become completely invisible, only to reappear when it dries (maybe slightly fainter?).</p>
<h2 id="First-print"><a href="#First-print" class="headerlink" title="First print"></a>First print</h2><p>I decided to print a file from the SD card, and timelapse this <em>historic</em> moment.
I had already set up Octoprint on my Rapsberry Pi, and so I tried to print the example cat file.
5 seconds in, it aborted.
Why??</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200827_162729.jpg" alt="Aborted here every time"></p>
<p>Octoprint noticed that the connection was lost.
I tried it a few times and got the same results.
It always fails in exactly the same places.
I tried everything!
I was eventually somehow able to print a Benchy, but how can I stop this from happening again?</p>

<p>It took 2 hours.
Yes, I watched it almost the entire time!
(Partly because it was 2am and I needed it to finish so I could sleep)</p>

<p>We tried to see if it would float (it does, just not upright…), and on shaking the water off I let go.
So the chimney broke off.
It fits in the back compartment nicely though!</p>
