        <p>I want to be able to print tripod-mountable things, with the first order of business being a webcam mount so I can film timelapses of my prints.
Lots of these exist on Thingiverse already, even for this specific webcam (an old Logitech C130), but I’m not satisfied.
It shouldn’t require extra bolts!
So I’ll design one myself.
This means being able to screw onto a standard tripod screw, so I’ll have to print the thread.
I know this would be a real pain to model manually.
I found that Autodesk Fusion 360 can mostly automate this, and it’s relatively simple to add clearances!</p>
<p>First, I designed a simple hex nut without any extra clearance (B2), as the bolt would be a real steel one and not a printed one.
This came out fine, but was much too tight.
It was even difficult to force something into it.
I put some text on it to keep a track of the type and settings, but it didn’t come out at all.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200829_024629.jpg" alt="First bolt print"></p>
<p>The second has some clearance.
This was easier to force into, but still became more difficult the further it went in.
The more-engraved text was not readable.</p>
<p>Now I was pretty sure that I could get the nut right the next time, so would combined it with the mounting part in a single print.</p>
<p>Using the original as reference, I made a 1:1 reconstruction using a digital caliper and Fusion 360.
This took lots of time but I still have to learn how it works.
History, sketches, components, analysis planes, bevels, even exporting to <code>.STL</code> isn’t obvious or straight forward.
The original piece was a bit complicated, with flat sections to restrict movement and provide some friction.</p>
<p>The final result was almost perfect.
The thread is great.
The bevel is less than I expected.
The end recesses are not wide enough for the end cap and screw, but I wanted it to go in so I forced it.
This caused it to split slightly, but otherwise the webcam is held well, and all movement is as it was on the old one.
Nice!
I’ll adjust the design but I won’t re-print it.</p>

        <p>My new 3D printer (Creality Ender 3 V2) arrived today!
It only took 5 days to arrive, from CZ.
This weekend is a long one due to the bank holiday - time to build!
I’m keeping this blog as a self-reference for the things I learned, and somewhere to post my settings and photos.</p>
<h2 id="Construction"><a href="#Construction" class="headerlink" title="Construction"></a>Construction</h2><p>I set it up very carfeully following YouTube videos.
It was difficult to tell which way I had to tighten the concentric casters, but everything went smoothly.</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/s_IMG_20200827_155007.jpg" alt="Newly assembled 3D printer"></p>
<p>I did however scratch the bed a bit.
Not convinced it’s a problem.
When wiping the bed down, the scratches become completely invisible, only to reappear when it dries (maybe slightly fainter?).</p>
<h2 id="First-print"><a href="#First-print" class="headerlink" title="First print"></a>First print</h2><p>I decided to print a file from the SD card, and timelapse this <em>historic</em> moment.
I had already set up Octoprint on my Rapsberry Pi, and so I tried to print the example cat file.
5 seconds in, it aborted.
Why??</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200827_162729.jpg" alt="Aborted here every time"></p>
<p>Octoprint noticed that the connection was lost.
I tried it a few times and got the same results.
It always fails in exactly the same places.
I tried everything!
I was eventually somehow able to print a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622">Benchy</a>, but how can I stop this from happening again?</p>

<p>It took 2 hours.
Yes, I watched it almost the entire time!
(Partly because it was 2am and I needed it to finish so I could sleep)</p>
<p><img src="/3dprint/images/m_IMG_20200901_181455.jpg" alt="First Benchy!"></p>
<p>We tried to see if it would float (it does, just not upright…), and on shaking the water off I let go.
So the chimney broke off.
It fits in the back compartment nicely though!</p>
